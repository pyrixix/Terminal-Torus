# Terminal Torus

**A real-time, rotating 3D ASCII doughnut rendered entirely in your terminal.**  
Written in Python. Pure character-based sorcery.

## How It Works

This script is based on the brilliant 3D torus projection technique by Shivangi Jha. It simulates a rotating doughnut by:
- Calculating XYZ coordinates on a torus
- Applying 3D-to-2D perspective projection
- Using depth buffers for realistic occlusion
- Mapping brightness levels to ASCII characters

The result? A hypnotic, rotating green torus... in your terminal.

*Because sometimes, a spinning ASCII doughnut is all the clarity you need.*
